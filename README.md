**##Database:** Microsoft Sql Server   

**##Product:**
Student Enrollment System webpage   

**##Project Description:**
	The system would allow educational organizations to enroll students into courses and set the program timetable and assign who teaches these courses. The system would have a website as the front end and a database as the back end.    
  
**##Stakeholders:**

**##Project Requirements as User Stories:**   
  
1.As a Student, I want to access the website and view the available course to enroll in with the time and place, who teaches the course, and how many courses I can enroll in. Also, I would like a short description or link to the course syllabus. I want this to be done with fewer clicks as possible.   

2.As a Student, I would like the system to show me a course plan and how my current course will affect my future enrollment.   

3.As a Student, I would like the ability to drop courses.   

4.As a student, I would like to be able to print my timetable and accede at any time.    

5.As a teacher, I would like to be able to print my timetable and student list.   

6.As a teacher, I would like to be able to access my previous timetable.   

7.As a student registration staff member, I would like to see all enrolled students in each course and the course information, including (location, time, teacher, and student count)    

8.As a student registration staff member, I would like the ability to enroll students directly and move students between course sections. Change the (location, time, and teacher).    

9.As a student registration staff member, I want to be able to find which students did not enroll in any course or under a certain limit.   

10.As a student registration staff member, the ability to print reports such as student lists, timetables, locations, induvial timetables for students and teachers.   

11.As a student registration manager, the Student Enrollment System must not have any time conflict on locations, courses, students, and teachers and does not allow staff to do so.     

12.As a student registration manager, the ability to print reports and statistics by semester and compare numbers between semesters about (count of students enrolled in specific courses compared to other semesters, how many new students enrolled for each semester, and withdraws and dropouts)

14.As a student registration manager, I would like to be able to add and edit (students, teachers, locations, courses)    

15.As an organization official, the system must be secured, and each user has a username and password. The system also must be stable.    

16.As an organization official, the front end must be a website built with python 3 and the back end with Microsoft SQL Server.    

17.As an organization official, I would like to see a demo version of the system after five weeks and a finalized version in 12 weeks.
