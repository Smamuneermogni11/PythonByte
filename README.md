## Features in Milestone 1: 

Backend: Database Backbone (Create Tables, Users Table and rols)  

Frontend: Web Page (Main: login page ,Student: Enrolment, Student: Courses Plan, Student: future Courses Plan, Lecturer: Timetable, Lecturer: Student Lists)

## 2 Iterations for Milestone 1 (4 weeks):
Iteration 1 (2 weeks): 

1. Develop Database Design 

2. Create Flask Project and Venv 

3. Create Database.	 

Iteration 2 (2 weeks): 

1. Create Template and Style.  

2. Create Webpage: (Main: login page ,Student: Enrolment, Student: Courses Plan, Student: future Courses Plan, Lecturer: Timetable, Lecturer: Student Lists) 

## Calculate Velocity:

Timeline: 4 weeks to milestone 1, 5 weeks to milestone 2

Iteration 1: 3 user stories x 8 story points = 24
Iteration 2: 7 user stories x 8 story points = 56

Total = 80

So, your average velocity is 80 รท 2 = 40.

Starting velocity: 40 %
Total: 6 hours per week
Current: 4 hours per week

# Testing the web page: 

$ pip install pytest
from front_page import app

def test_front_page():
    response = app.test_client().get('/')

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.data == b'PythonByte!'
    
## To run the test:
pytest test_front_page.py
